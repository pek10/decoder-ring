# decoder-ring
Project description: Decoder ring
You're planning a surprise birthday party for a friend who loves escape rooms and puzzles. What better way to practice your new coding skills than to build an application that will help you encode and decode all kinds of fun messages?

For at least part of this project, try following a TDD process. Once you get the hang of it, you'll find that writing tests can be a great way to focus your workflow.
